![build](https://github.com/uhppoted/node-red-contrib-uhppoted/workflows/build/badge.svg)

Node-RED module that implements an API for interacting with a UHPPOTE TCP/IP Wiegand access controller board. The API supports device and card management as well as handling for events.

**Please note that as of version 1.1.8, the _controllers_ list in the _config_ is being deprecated in favour of using a _controller_ object
in the input message payload to a _uhppoted_ node. Although the legacy implementation will be supported at least until the next major release
you are encouraged to update your flows. For more information see the [controllers](#controllers) section.**

#### Requirements:
- `node‑red` version 2.2.3+
- `node.js` version 14.18.3+

For the latest updates see the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/uhppoted/node-red-contrib-uhppoted/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

#### Installation

To install the stable version use the `Menu - Manage palette` option and search for `node-red-contrib-uhppoted`,
or run the following command in your Node-RED user directory (e.g. `~/.node-red` on MacOS and Linux):

    npm install node-red-contrib-uhppoted

Restart your Node-RED instance and you should have the `uhppoted` nodes available in the palette.

If you want to try the development version from the [node‑red‑contrib‑uhppoted](https://github.com/uhppoted/node-red-contrib-uhppoted) _github_
repository:

    cd ~/.node-red/node_modules
    git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/node-red-contrib-uhppoted.git
    cd node-red-contrib-uhppoted
    npm install

##### _Upgrading from v0.x_

_Please note that updating from `node-red-contrib-uhppoted` v0.x to v1.x is a breaking change. `node-red-contrib-uhppoted` v1.0
fixed node name conflicts with other NodeRED modules and unfortunately changing node names throughout requires a breaking change._

_Please see:_
- _[Issue #11: config node name conflict](https://github.com/uhppoted/node-red-contrib-uhppoted/issues/11) for the original cause_
- _[Discussion: prefixing all nodes with uhppoted- to avoid naming conflicts](https://github.com/uhppoted/node-red-contrib-uhppoted/discussions/12) for any comments and further discussion._

All nodes take a message with JSON object payload as input and send a message with a JSON object payload as output.

##### Configuration

The nodes can (optionally) accept a configuration that overrides the default settings:

|               | Description                                    | Default           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `timeout`     | Request execution timeout (in milliseconds)    | `5000`            |
| `bind`        | UDP `address` to bind to for requests          | `0.0.0.0`         |
| `broadcast`   | UDP `address` for broadcast requests           | `255.255.255.255` |
| `listen`      | UDP address:port on which to listen for events | `0.0.0.0:60000`   |
| `controllers` | List of controller specific IPv4 address:port overrides for systems where a controller is either not located on the same LAN (i.e. cannot receive or respond to UDP broadcasts) or where directed UDP messages are preferred. | `(none)` |
| `debug`      | Enables logging of request/response messages to the console | `false` |

##### Controllers

All nodes (other than `get-devices`) expect a controller in the input message payload. v1.8+ supports two formats for the controller:
- the (legacy) implementation which expects the controller serial number as a device ID:
```
{
    "deviceId": 405419896
}
```
- the revised implementation which expects the `controller` as an object:
```
{
    "controller": {
        "id": 405419896,
        "address": "192.168.1.100",
        "protocol": "tcp"
    }
}

- id: controller serial number
- address: controller IPv4 address (optional)
- protocol: 'udp' or 'tcp' (optional)

Defaults to UDP broadcast transport if the address is null or the protocol is not 'tcp'.
```

**NOTE:**

_The legacy implementation will be supported until at least the next major release but any future enhancements will expect the _controller_
object and you are encouraged to update your flows accordingly._ 

In most cases, this is simply a matter of updating the input message payload to a _uhppoted_ node from something like:
```
{
    "deviceId": 405419896,
    "cardNumber": 65537
}
```
to
```
{
    "controller": {
        "id": 405419896
    },
    "cardNumber": 65537
}
```
